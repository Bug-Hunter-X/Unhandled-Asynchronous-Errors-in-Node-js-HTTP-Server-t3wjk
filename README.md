# Unhandled Asynchronous Errors in Node.js HTTP Server

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js server-side development: improper handling of errors within asynchronous operations.  The `bug.js` file shows a scenario where an error in an asynchronous callback can lead to a server crash or unexpected behavior if not handled correctly. The `bugSolution.js` illustrates a robust approach to handle such errors. 

## Problem

Asynchronous operations, common in Node.js, can produce errors that are not immediately caught.  If not handled correctly, these errors can propagate up and halt the server or cause unexpected response behaviors. 

## Solution

The solution ensures that all possible error paths are handled within the asynchronous operation's callback to prevent unhandled rejections or incomplete responses.
